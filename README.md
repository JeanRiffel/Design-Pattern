# What does really Desing Patterns means?
  
  Placing in simple words Desing Patterns means that we have repeatable solution to a common bunch of problems from software development. We could say there  are three important branches which we can use for applying Desing Patterns.
  
  
  ## There are the follows:
  
  ### Creational Patterns: These design patterns are all about instantiation, so we have on this topic:
  
     #### - Abstract Factory:
     
     #### - Factory Method:
     
     #### - Builder:
     
     #### - Prototype:
     
     #### - Singleton:
    
  ### Behavioral Patterns
  
  
  
  ### Structural Patterns
