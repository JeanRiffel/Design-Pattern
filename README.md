# What does really Desing Patterns means?
  
  Placing in simple words Desing Patterns means that we have repeatable solution to a common bunch of problems from software development. We could say there  are three important branches which we can use for applying Desing Patterns.
  
  
  ## There are the follows:
  
  ### Creational Patterns: These design patterns are all about instantiation, so we have on this topic:
  
   #### - Abstract Factory:
      
      * Create a family of objects which share a common interface;
      * Delegate the instantiation to another object;
      * Use composition;
     
   #### - Factory Method:
     
      * Use inheritance to decide the object to be instantiated;
      * Dependens on inheritance;
     
   #### - Builder:
   
      * Build a single type of objects;
      * Is tipically used when the object creation is more complex than just calling a constructor;
           
   #### - Prototype:
   
      * This pattern is used to duplicate or clone objects when is important to enhance performance for dealing with complexity or costly.
      * In short terms when the developer has to deal with complex objects is possible to use this pattern.
     
   #### - Singleton:
   
      * Creates a single tupe of objects;
      * Ensure that a class has just a single instance;
      * Provide a global access point to that instance;
